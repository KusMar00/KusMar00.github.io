      "A project built in collaboration with DHI during a course at ITU on industrial software engineering. A big part of this project was to learn about and implement the Scrum framework for development. This involved having a dedicated scrum master, a product owner and other developers on the team, as well as having a number of weekly ceremonies (sprint planning, review, retrospective, daily standups). The product itself is an internal news platform, for showcasing weather related news on a map of Denmark.",
